# Notes App

A simple full-stack Notes application developed as part of the **Full Stack Open** course by the University of Helsinki (Osa 3 â€“ Backend).

This project focuses on building a backend using **Node.js** and **Express**, and connecting it with a frontend interface. Through this project, I learned how to structure backend code, create RESTful APIs, and connect to a database (MongoDB). I also practiced using middleware, error handling, and deploying to services like Render or Fly.io.
